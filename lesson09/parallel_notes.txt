coarse grained processing
code is itentical word for word
copied and put on different data files
each file given a rank 
write code with a {}variable which is defined based on rank or file name, so code is identical, but changes for what file its applied to
Or Also you can write code to go between them
communicator: thing that can go between ranks

"Embarrasingly Parallel"
if it doesnt matter what order theyre run in, how long apart theyre run
there is no interdependence between tasks 
example: downloading data from a source. you need a bunch of different files but dont want to wait one after the other
example: loop. if you can write a loop, and it doesnt matter what order its being done in, it can be done parallel
